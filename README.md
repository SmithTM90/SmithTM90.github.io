# Travis Smith Portfolio

Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio site, it will probably go through a lot of changes as time goes on, but it's overall purpose is to portray myself to others (potential employers) in a professional way.

## Technologies

I built this portfolio based off of a Bootstrap template, but I will be looking to change that in the future.
I also used:
  -HTML
  -CSS
  -JavaScript
  -AngularJS
  
## Planned Updates

Firstly, I need to update the styling and make it my own, rather than using a template. I also need to update the projects section with more of my works, and update some of the items that are already in place.

Keeping everything up to date with where I am at in my development experience.
